Good Decisions
==============

Tools to separate useful information from nonsense in the information age

## Introduction

When living in a small village, a good strategy for success is paying attention to your elders. The older folk have been doing whatever it is that you probably want to do, but for many years. If you listened when they spoke about their experiences, you could acquire effective techniques to use (and deceptively harmful ones to avoid) without the time and risk of discovering them yourself.

But this isn't blind trust. It could be assumed that it is in the elder's best interest for the village to succeed, so they probably wouldn't deliberately give you bad advice. If you were skeptical, you could always check how others were faring that also took the elder's advice. If their followers were succeeding, that would be strong evidence to support the belief that the elder can be trusted as an expert. Even after all that, if that guy secretly hated you and deliberately gave you bad advice, you (and the rest of the village) know where he sleeps, in the event he warrants a little frontier justice.

The authorities in my world couldn't be more different. My "village" consists of hundreds of millions of people, making any self-proclaimed experts anonymous and untouchable. They suffer no repercussions for hurting those that obey them. This creates an environment where predators can easily masquerade as wise elders to proffer advice to benefit themselves, and to the detriment of their followers. Previously unknown "experts" appear in mass media channels: television, radio, newspapers, magazines, books, mail, telephone, road signs, blurt out ideas, then disappear. Even worse, strange preachers, teachers, politicians, and salespeople confront you directly and pressure acquiescence. And that's without mentioning the biggest garbage dump of information in the history of mankind: The Internet.

I love the Internet. I believe that the average human has access to more accurate, helpful, and wondrous information than than ever before. Unfortunately, there is an even grater increase in inaccuracies, honest mistakes, deliberate hoaxes, manipulative ploys, and simple, good, old-fashioned nonsense. So what does this mean to us? Are we doomed to be mislead forever? Can we not trust anyone? No. First, my point is that we should not automatically assume that just because something walks and quacks like an authority figure, it is an authority figure. There are some simple techniques that can quickly be learned and used to dismiss the worst of the pretenders. Also, we should make sure that our own skills at judging fact from fiction without the need for an authority are up to par. Again, there are a few simple rules to follow that can get you there fast. If you care about the quality of information you accept and are willing to put in a little effort, there is no reason that anyone can't make significant improvements in their critical thinking skills.

The ability to tell good information from not is the skill that makes the difference between a person who can use information as a powerful tool for their own success, and one that is doomed to be a victim. It is the fire, the stone axe, steel, and gunpowder of the information age. How to build, hone, and wield that tool is what I would like to show you.

We live in a world where the amount of effort is much less and reward much for for those who want to appear to be an authority than it is to actually becoming one.

#### Why Should We Trust You?

I'n not asking you to, nor will I. But I encourage you use the same critical thinking techniques I recommend on everything, even me and my ideas. Please do. I am not perfect, and I am sure I have made some mistakes and missed opportunities for improvement. And at the very least it's not hypocritical.

#### Seriously Though, What Do You Get Out of This?

OK, I admit that I the reason I want people to get better at finding truth and spotting lies is not out of a sense of altruism for my fellow man. I have a personal motive. I despise incompetent authority. I loath it with a fire that burns in my chest. I hate politicians that rule by inciting fear and persecution of the powerless and downtrodden. I hate those that abuse their positions to torment others for no reason but to feel powerful. I hate salespeople that heartlessly take advantage of vulnerable prey. I hate snake oil peddlers that reap obscene profits from the desperation of the and sick and dying. I hate fake experts that make the world more ignorant with their nonsense. The more people are resistent to the lies of these scumbags, the worse it is for them. And that makes me feel good.

## Overview

Pick up a scrap piece of paper and crumple it into a ball. Now stand up, extend your arm palm down, and prepare to drop the paper ball. But don't drop it yet. First, imagine what will happen when you let go. Watch the action in your mind. How fast does the paper fall? Where does it come to rest? Once you have a good guess about what will happen, let go. I am guessing what you thought would happen was very close to what actually happened, but not exactly the same.

For you to do this trick - making an accurate prediction for the results of an action on a situation - you need some serious computational hardware. (Or in our instance, I believe it is called *wetware*.) You need to employ concepts like speed, weight, gravity, time, distance, air resistance, among others. (You may not be consciously aware of it, but it's there.) These rules are used to run a simulation of the paper dropping inside your mind.

The completeness and precision of these rules create an understanding of a situation. This miniature model of this paper dropping activity in your brain won't tell to why anything is happening, but it should give accurate results, that's what is important. It's important because if you have accurate observations, clear definitions, and thorough understanding of your world, you can make good decisions.

### Good Decisions

So what are "good" decisions, exactly? They are chosen actions to solve problems. What are problems? Problems are situations that prevent us from reaching our goals? But what are your goals? Are there better and worse goals? Do you have any? How do you find out?

#### Goals

Being aware of your own goals is a critical part of living a successful life. Knowing what you want to accomplish is at the core of the decision making process. How else could you judge if an outcome is successful if you don't care what is accomplished? Many false authorities will try to convince you that you need something from them. They will claim they have a solution to your problems. But if you don't know what your goals are, how do you know these are problems you actually have?

##### Unhealthy Goals

##### Core Skills

1. Caring For Yourself
2. Communication
3. Creation
4. Comprehend Your World

#### Observation

Measurement and sensory experiences

"Nothing is exact"

#### Identification

What do you call it when a definition is used against a set of data to detect a symbol?

> Identify
> 2. To establish the identity of; to prove to be the same with something described, claimed, or asserted; as, to identify stolen property.

"Nothing is exact"

#### Rules of Belief

Our beliefs are not sacred truths. They are simplistic models that imitate the world around us. The most powerful ones are often the most broad and simplified. Try not to get too stubbornly attached to yours.

"Nothing is exact"

#### Problem Solving

If you have accurate and comprehensive observations, definitions, and beliefs, we can use them to make good decisions. If any one of those is bad - inaccurate, ambiguous, or irrational - then you could be making some very bad life choices.

## Measurements and Facts

## Symbols and Counting

## Rules

## Problem Solving

## Shared Spaces

Damn, I guess I have to start talking about social behavior.

### Rules

Rules should be:

1. Effective - They must be proven to solve a problem.
2. Beneficial - They problems they solve should provide more benefit than the harm of the problems they create.
3. Equitable - The rules should apply to and effect everyone as similarly as possible. Otherwise it isn't a rule, it's a command.
