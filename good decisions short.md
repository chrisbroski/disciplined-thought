Good Decisions
==============

## Welcome to the Disinformation Age

Are you exhausted of being unrelentingly mislead by politicians, religious leaders and powerful organizations?

Are you no longer tolerant of losing time and money to unscrupulous salespeople, charlatans, and other financial predators?

Our phones, computers, and televisions are connected to the greatest communication and information system the world has even known, and it continues to get larger every day. Unfortunately, most of that information isn't beneficial to you. And some of it is actively harmful and designed to take advantage of others. but how can you tell the difference between sense and nonsense, between truth and lies, between those that wish to help you and those that want to hurt you?

The good news is that this is not an impossible scenario.  With a few simple techniques, you can learn separate fact from fiction.

## Warning - Do Not Read Further Until You ARe Ready to Let Go of Your Beliefs

Once you acquire the tools to spot nonsense, it is only a matter of time before they point toward yourself. You will discover that some of your beliefs are not as unquestioningly valuable as you once believed they were. And these may be what gets you to sleep at night and spur you on through difficult days.

Growing into a rational person can be an emotional and alienating experience as your eyes open to the shared delusions of your culture.

## Facts

"That is a *fact*!"

You probably hear this often. But claiming that something is a fact, even when yelling and pounding on a table, does not make it a fact.

A *fact* is an observation that has been consistently made by several different, independent observers. A person can swear that they saw something, and I would have no reason to accuse them of lying or being mistaken. But unless others have also, independently, made the same observation, it does not rise to the level of *fact*.

It is a simple process to document independent observations. Unless the person making the claim of factualness can show this, you have not obligation to accept what they say as fact.

## Identification

And observation can be described, but when something is specifically identified using a clear definition from an observation, then it becomes something else. For example, while looking at a photograph one could say:

> It appears to contain a dark colored, furry, humanoid figure.

That's a reasonable, objective description. Or we could attempt to identify it

> It's a picture of bigfoot.

or

> It's a picture of a man in a gorilla costume.

Either identification is possible from the presented facts, so an identification can't be made with confidence. And this is assuming we are using clear and agreed-upon definitions. Good definitions must be logical, unambiguous, accurate, and agreed upon by all parties.

## Belief

Beliefs go on step beyond simple facts and labels. They are general statements that describe how the world works and so can be used to make predictions. They can take the form of a general statement ("Most people have two legs.") a cause-and-effect relationship ("If you poke a sleeping bear, it could go very badly for you.")
