Unscrupulous salespeople, charlatans, and other financial predators will say and do whatever it takes to get your money.

## Welcome to the Disinformation Age

Our phones, computers, and televisions are connected to the greatest communication and information system the world has even known, and every day it gets larger. Unfortunately, most of the information won't help you. Some is even harmful - purposely designed to take advantage of others. But how we separate sense and nonsense, truth and lies, between those that want to help you and those that cause misery and suffering?

But it isn't hopeless. There are simple and effective ways to tell helpful ideas from poisonous ones.

## Warning - Do Not Read Further If You Like Your Beliefs

After spotting nonsense is an easy habit, it is only a matter of time before you aim it at yourself. You may discover that some of your favorite beliefs are not as great as you thought. And these may be the ones that get you to sleep at night and motivate you through difficult days.

Growing into a rational person can be an emotional and alienating experience as your eyes open your personal and cultural delusions. Don't start the journey unless you are prepared.

## Facts

"That is a *fact*!"

You probably hear this often. But claiming that something is a fact, even when yelling and pounding on a table, does not make it a fact.

A *fact* is an observation that has been consistently made by several different, independent observers. A person can swear that they saw something, and I would have no reason to accuse them of lying or being mistaken. But unless others have also, independently, made the same observation, it does not rise to the level of *fact*.

It is a simple process to document independent observations. Unless the person making the claim of factualness can show this, you have not obligation to accept what they say as fact.

## Identification

And observation can be described, but when something is specifically identified using a clear definition from an observation, then it becomes something else. For example, while looking at a photograph one could say:

> It appears to contain a dark colored, furry, humanoid figure.

That's a reasonable, objective description. Or we could attempt to identify it

> It's a picture of bigfoot.

or

> It's a picture of a man in a gorilla costume.

Either identification is possible from the presented facts, so an identification can't be made with confidence. And this is assuming we are using clear and agreed-upon definitions. Good definitions must be logical, unambiguous, accurate, and agreed upon by all parties.

## Belief

Beliefs go on step beyond simple facts and labels. They are general statements that describe how the world works and so can be used to make predictions. They can take the form of a general statement ("Most people have two legs.") a cause-and-effect relationship ("If you poke a sleeping bear, it could go very badly for you.")
